If fund-raising amount is between 20000 and 40000, the total 6 billion PRO will be distributed according to the total number of injected ETH to calculate the corresponding share of investors.

In the premise of raising 40000ETH, each ETH can exchange for 150000 PRO; and if we raise 30000ETH, each ETH can exchange for 200000 PRO; if we just reach 20000ETH minimum fundraising, each ETH can exchange for 300000 PRO.
