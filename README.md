#### 7.Why do we raise EOS instead of ETH in ProChain's ICO?

ProChain is based on the EOS blockchain operating system. Any operation by the users will require EOS token as a guarantee to provide data transmission bandwidth. In contrast, each operation on Ethereum will cost a lot of gas which will be paid by users. And the transaction speed of Ethereum is much more slower than EOS that are not suitable for high concurrent applications. This is why ProChain is based on EOS platform.

No, ProChain and MLM mechanisms vary widely. MLM organizations have significant pyramid characteristics, the higher level of members the higher bonus they can get. MLM levels is up to 8 to 10. In contrast, ProChain's user level is flat. Specifically, each account can only spread the quest to their friends. A new promoter who followed one of these friends will not bring benefits to the original account, will only bring benefits for this friend.

The total amount of PRO is 10 billion. The duration of ICO is 30 days with 6 billion tokens. Our goal is to raise a maximum of 6 million EOS and a minimum of 3 million.

If fund-raising amount is between 3 billion and 6 billion, the total 6 billion PRO will be distributed according to the total number of injected EOS to calculate the corresponding share of investors.

In the premise of raising more than 6 million EOS, each EOS can exchange for 1000 PRO; and if we raise 5 million EOS, each EOS can exchange for 1200 PRO; if we just reach 3 million minimum fundraising, each EOS can exchange for 2000 PRO.
